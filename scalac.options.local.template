# To change your local scalac configuration - e.g., to turn off assertions -
# rename this file by removing the ".template" suffix. The scalac options in
# this file will take precedence over the ones defined in the file "scalac.options"
#
# This file takes exactly one scalac flag per line; empty lines and whitespace at
# the beginning and end are trimmed and "#" and "//" mark comment lines.
