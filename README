BAT is a Java Bytecode library written in Scala 2.9.x that facilitates generating
representations of Java Bytecode that suit your needs. You can think of a BAT
as a software product line for bytecode representations.

Currently, four representations are provided.

1) Native
Basically, a one to one representation of the class file; Java Bytecode's constant pool is 
not resolved and instructions are not made explicit.

2) Resolved
An object-oriented representation that facilitates writing analysis against the
bytecode. The constant pool is completely resolved and all instructions are 
explicitly represented; most standard Java Bytecode annotations are represented.

3) Prolog 
A representation of Java Bytecode as a set of Prolog facts. This representation
builds upon the resolved representation and basically represents all information
that are represented by the resolved representation.

4) XML
A representation of Java Bytecode as XML. Currently, instructions are not 
represented.

If you need "your own" representation or if you miss a certain feature, just
write us an email. 

Currently, BAT does not support manipulating existing Java class files and we have
no intentions to add this feature in the near future.
