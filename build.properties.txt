# To customize BAT to your setup:
# (1) 	make a copy of this file named "build.properties" which
# 	is stored in BAT's root directory.
# (2) 	Specify the parameters mentioned below.

# The home of your Scala installation (Scala 2.9 is required).
# E.g.,
# scala.home=/opt/scala-2.9.final

# If the Scala libraries are not stored in the lib
# directory below your "scala.home" directory, then
# you have to set the "scala.lib" property.
# E.g.,
# scala.lib=opt/scala-2.9.final/lib
