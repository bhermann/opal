/**
 * Specifies if all instances of a respective type (this includes the instances of the
 * type's subtypes) are (conditionally) immutable. Conditionally immutable means that only the
 * instance of the type itself is guaranteed to be immutable, but not all reachable objects.
 * In general, all -- so called -- immutable collections are only conditionally immutable. I.e.,
 * the collection as a whole is only immutable if only immutable objects are stored in the
 * collection. If this is not the case, the collection is only conditionally immutable.
 *
 * This property is of particular interest if the precise type cannot be computed statically. This
 * property basically depends on the [[org.opalj.br.analyses.cg.TypeExtensibilityKey]] and
 * [[ClassImmutability]].
