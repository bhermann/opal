 * == Property manifestations ==
 *
 * 1. declared final
 *   - actually directly declared as final
 *
 * 1. lazy initialized
 *   - all field writes and reads have to be known
 *     - OPA: all private fields
 *     - CPA: all private and package private fields and all protected and public fields that are not accessible by a client
 *     - APP: all fields
 *   - all writes have to be guarded by a test if the field still has the default value
 *   - all reads happen after initialization of the field and are either also guarded by test or happen directly after a field write
 *   - the field is set at most once to a value that is not the default value (`0`, `0l`, `0f`, `0d`, `null`)
 *
 * 1. effectively final
 *   - all criteria of the lazy initialized field have to hold (see previous section)
 *   - all reads and writes have to be guarded by the same (synchronization) lock.
 *
 * 1. non-final
 *   - a field is non final if non of the the previous cases holds
 *   - e.g. not all reads and writes of the field are known
