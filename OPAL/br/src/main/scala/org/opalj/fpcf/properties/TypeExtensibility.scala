package properties

/**
 * This property describes if a type (class, interface) is further extensible by yet unknown
 * types (that is, can be (transitively) inherited from).
 * This property generally depends on the kind of the project. If the project is an application,
 * all classes are considered to be closed unless we explicitly know that some specific classes/
 * interfaces are used in combination with class loading to load new (unknown) classes at runtime.
 * I.e., the class hierarchy is basically considered to be fixed; if the
 * analyzed project is a library then the result depends on the concrete assumption about the
 * openness of the library.
 *
 * == Extensibility w.r.t. the open-packages assumption ==
 *
 * A class is extensible if:
 *  - the class is not (effectively) final
 *  - one of its subclasses is extensible
 *
 * == Extensibility w.r.t. the closed-packages assumption ==
 *
 * A class is extensible if:
 *  - the class is public and not (effectively) final
 *  - one of its subclasses is extensible
 *
 * == Special cases ==
 *
 * If a class is defined in a package starting with '''java.*''', it always has to be treated like
 * classes that are analyzed w.r.t. to closed-packages assumption. This is necessary because the
 * default `ClassLoader` prevents the definition of further classes within these packages, hence,
 * they are closed by definition.
 *
 * If the analyzed codebase has an incomplete type hierarchy which leads to unknown subtype
 * relationships, it is necessary to add these particular classes to the computed set of
 * extensible classes.
