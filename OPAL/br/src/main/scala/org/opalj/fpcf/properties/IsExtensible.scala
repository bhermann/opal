/**
 * This set property describes if a class is further extensible by yet unknown types (i.e., can be (transitively) inherited from).
 * This property generally depends on the kind of the project. If the project is an application, all classes
 * are considered to be closed; i.e., the class hierarchy is considered to be fixed; if the
 * analyzed project is a library then the result depends on the concrete assumption about the
 * openness of the library.
 *
 * == Extensibility w.r.t. the open-packages assumption ==
 *
 * A class is extensible if:
 *  $ - the class is not (effectively) final
 *  $ - one of its subclasses is extensible
 *
 * == Extensibility w.r.t. the closed-packages assumption ==
 *
 * A class is extensible if:
 *  $ - the class is public and not (effectively) final
 *  $ - one of its subclasses is extensible
 *
 * == Special cases ==
 *
 * If a class is defined in a package starting with '''java.*''', it has to be treated like classes that are
 * analyzed w.r.t. to closed-packages assumption. This is necessary because the default `ClassLoader` prevents
 * the definition of further classes within these packages, hence, they are closed by definition.
 *
 * If the analyzed codebase has an incomplete type hierarchy which leads to unknown subtype relationships, it is
 * necessary to add these particular classes to the computed set of extensible classes.
