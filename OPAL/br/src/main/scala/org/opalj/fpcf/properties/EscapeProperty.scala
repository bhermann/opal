/**
 * Describes lifetime of allocated objects. If the lifetime of an object 'o' that is
 * allocated in a method 'm' and in thread 't' exceeds the lifetime of 'm', we say 'o' has the
 * property MethodEscape. Whereas if the lifetime of 'o' exceeds the lifetime of 't', 'o' has
 * the property GlobalEscape. Otherwise it has the property NoEscape.
 * The property values are ordered as follows: NoEscape < MethodEscape < GlobalEscape.
 * Algorithms can improve their efficiency by over approximating this property, i.e. for object
 * 'o' with actual property 'p' it is okay to say 'o' has property 'p*' if 'p'<'p*'.
