/**
 * Describes the purity of a method. A method is pure if its result only depends on its inputs
 * and/or immutable global state and the execution of the method does not have any side effects;
 * the method's inputs include the current object that is the receiver of the call.
 *
 * '''This analysis follows the definition found on wikipedia:'''
 *
 * [...] a function may be considered a pure function if both of the following statements about
 * the function hold:
 *  -   The function always evaluates to the same result value given the same argument value(s).
 *      The function result value cannot depend on any hidden information or state that may change
 *      while program execution proceeds or between different executions of the program, nor can it
 *      depend on any external input from I/O devices.
 *
 *      '''Hence, using true constants (e.g., Math.e) is not a problem as well as creating
 *      intermediate (mutable) data structures.
 *      More precisely, methods are pure if the values they refer to always (even across program
 *      runs) have an identical shape and the precise location in the heap is not relevant (e.g.
 *      java.lang.Object.hashCode() and ...toString() are not pure).'''
 *
 *  -   Evaluation of the result does not cause any semantically observable side effect or output,
 *      such as mutation of mutable objects or output to I/O devices.
 *      The result value need not depend on all (or any) of the argument values. However, it must
 *      depend on nothing other than the argument values. The function may return multiple result
 *      values and these conditions must apply to all returned values for the function to be
 *      considered pure. If an argument is "call-by-reference", any parameter mutation will alter
 *      the value of the argument outside the function, which will render the function impure.
 *
 * Given the preceeding specification, the purity of a method is described by the subclasses of
 * this property:
 *
 * [[ImpureBase]] methods have no constraints on their behavior. They may have side effect and
 * depend on all accessible (global) state. Analyses can always return `Impure` as a safe default
 * value - even if they are not able to prove that a method is indeed impure; however, in the
 * latter case using [[MaybePure]] is recommended as this enable potentially succeeding Analyses
 * to refine the property. Besides `Impure` there are several other implementations of
 * [[ImpureBase]] that are to be treated identically to `Impure` but which give additional reasoning
 * why the analysis classified a method as impure.
 *
 * [[SideEffectFree]] methods may depend on all accessible (and mutable) state, but may not have
 * any side effects.
 * In single-threaded execution, this means that the object graph of the program may not
 * have changed between invocation of the method and its return, except for potentially additional
 * objects allocated by the method. For multi-threaded execution, the object graph may not change
 * due to the invocation of the method, again except allocation of new objects. Note that the object
 * graph may change during execution of the method due to other methods executing on concurrent
 * threads. The method must not have any effects (besides consumption of resources like memory and
 * processor time) on methods executing concurrently, in particular it may not acquire any locks on
 * objects that concurrent methods could also try to acquire.
 *
 * Analyses may return [[SideEffectFree]] as a safe default value if they are unable to guarantee
 * that a method is [[Pure]], even if it is. However, to return `SideEffectFree` the analysis has
 * to guarantee that the method does not have any side effects.
 *
 * [[Pure]] methods must be side effect free as above, but additionally, their result may only
 * depend on their parameters (including the receiver object) and global constants. In particular,
 * the result of a pure method must be structurally identical each time the method is invoked with
 * structurally identical parameters.
 * I.e., pure methods may depend on the aliasing relation between their
 * parameters or between their parameters and global constants.  E.g., the following method is
 * pure:
 * {{{
 * def cmp(s: String) : Boolean = {
 *      // Reference(!) comparison of s with the interned string "Demo":
 *      s eq "Demo";
 * }
 * }}}
 * In multi-threaded execution, pure methods can not depend on any mutable state of their
 * parameters if that state might be mutated by concurrently executing methods.
 *
 * Analyses may return [[Pure]] only if they are able to guarantee that a method fulfills these
 * requirements.
 *
 * [[SideEffectFreeWithoutAllocations]] and [[PureWithoutAllocations]] have the same requirements as
 * [[SideEffectFree]] and [[Pure]], but invoking methods with these properties may not cause any
 * allocation heap objects (including arrays).
 *
 * [[ExternallySideEffectFree]] and [[ExternallyPure]] methods are also similar to
 * [[SideEffectFree]] and [[Pure]] methods, respectively, but may modify their receiver object.
 * These properties may be used to detect changes that are confined because the receiver object is
 * under the control of the caller.
 *
 * [[DomainSpecificSideEffectFree]] and [[DomainSpecificPure]] methods may perform actions that are
 * generally considered impure (or non-deterministic in the case of `DomainSpecificPure`), but that
 * some clients may want to treat as pure. Such actions include, e.g. logging. A Rater is used to
 * identify such actions and the properties contain a set of reasons assigned by the Rater.
 *
 * [[DomainSpecificExternallySideEffectFree]] and [[DomainSpecificExternallyPure]] methods are
 * similar, but may again modify their receiver.
 *
 * [[ConditionallySideEffectFree]] and [[ConditionallyPure]] can be used by analyses to specify
 * intermediate results. `ConditionallySideEffectFree` methods are methods that are
 * [[SideEffectFree]] depending on other analysis results not yet available.
 * `ConditionallySideEffectFree` methods may not become [[Pure]] anymore. ConditionallyPure methods
 * are methods that may still become [[Pure]] depending on the properties of the depending entities.
 * Hence, `ConditionallyPure` methods might also become [[ImpureBase]] or [[SideEffectFree]], or
 * [[ConditionallySideEffectFree]].
 *
 * [[ConditionallySideEffectFreeWithoutAllocations]] and [[ConditionallyPureWithoutAllocations]] are
 * again similar, but such methods may still become [[SideEffectFreeWithoutAllocations]] or
 * [[PureWithoutAllocations]], respectively.
 *
 * [[ConditionallyExternallySideEffectFree]] and [[ConditionallyExternallyPure]] methods on the
 * other hand can only become [[ExternallySideEffectFree]] or [[ConditionallyPure]], respectively.
 * They might also become anything below these, such as [[ImpureBase]].
 *
 * [[ConditionallyDomainSpecificSideEffectFree]] and [[ConditionallyDomainSpecificPure]] methods are
 * methods that may only become [[DomainSpecificSideEffectFree]] or [[DomainSpecificPure]],
 * respectively. They might also become anything below these, such as [[ImpureBase]].
 *
 * [[ConditionallyDomainSpecificExternallySideEffectFree]] and
 * [[ConditionallyDomainSpecificExternallyPure]] methods are methods that may only become
 * [[DomainSpecificExternallySideEffectFree]] or [[DomainSpecificExternallyPure]], respectively.
 * They might also become anything below these, such as [[ImpureBase]].
 *
 * [[MaybePure]] is used as a default fallback value if no purity information could be computed for
 * a method. Conceptually, clients must treat this in the same way as [[ImpureBase]] except that
 * a future refinement may be possible.
