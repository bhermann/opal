 *
 * TODO
 * The ''key'' object to get a traversable of entry points. Entry points are particulary relevant to
 * construct call graphs.
 * See [[InitialEntryPointsKey]] for further details.
 *
 * This ''key'' reflectively instantiates the analysis that determines the program's entry points.
 * The respective analysis has to extend the trait [[InitialEntryPointsKey]] class.
 *
 * To configure which analysis is used use the key
 * `org.opalj.br.analyses.cg.InitialEntryPointKey.analysis` to specify the name of the class which
 * implements the analysis.
 *
 * @example
 *      {{{
 *      org.opalj.br.analyses {
 *          InitialEntryPointKey {
 *              analysis = "org.opalj.br.analyses.ApplicationEntryPointFinder"
