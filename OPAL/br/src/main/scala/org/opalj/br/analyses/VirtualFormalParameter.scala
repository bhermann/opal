/**
 * Explicitly models a formal parameter of an virtual method to make it possible to store it in the
 * property store and to compute properties for it.
 * In contrast to the [[FormalParameter]], which models a parameter of a concrete method, virtual
 * methods include every possible method that overrides the method attached to the
 * [[VirtualForwardingMethod]].
 *
 * The first parameter explicitly defined by the method will have the origin `-2`, the second one
 * will have the origin `-3` and so on.
 * That is, the origin of an explicitly declared parameter is always `-(parameter_index + 2)`.
 * The origin of the `this` parameter is `-1`.
 *
 * It should be used to aggregate the properties for every [[FormalParameter]] of a method included
 * in this virtual method.
 *
 * @note The computational type category of the parameters is ignored to ease the mapping.
 *
 * @note This encoding is also used by the default three address code representation
 *       generated using a local data-flow analysis (see [[org.opalj.tac.TACAI]]).
 *
 *       '''In case of the bytecode based data-flow analysis the origin used by the analysis
 *       reflects the position of the parameter value on the tac; see
 *       [[org.opalj.ai.parameterIndexToValueOrigin]].'''
 *
 *
 * @param method The virtual method which contains the formal parameter.
 * @param origin The origin associated with the parameter. See the general description for
 *               further details.
