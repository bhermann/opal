/**
 * Determines if a type (class or interface) is further (transitively) extensible by yet unknown
 * types (that is, can be (transitively) inherited from).
 *
 * == Special cases ==
 * If a class is defined in a package starting with '''java.*''', it always has to be treated like
 * classes that belong to a closed package. This is necessary because the default `ClassLoader`
 * prevents the definition of further classes within these packages, hence, they are closed by
 * definition.
 *
 * If the analyzed codebase has an incomplete type hierarchy, which leads to unknown subtype
 * relationships, it is necessary to add these particular classes to the computed set of
 * extensible classes.
