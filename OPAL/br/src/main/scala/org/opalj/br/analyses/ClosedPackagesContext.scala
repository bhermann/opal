/**
  * A common trait for all analyses that compute which packages are open or closed. A package is
  * considered open, if a developer is allowed to define a new class/interface within the package's
  * namespace. If a developer cannot define a new class/interface within the package's namespace,
  * the package is considered closed. An example for closed packages are the packages within the
  * java.* namespace of the JRE.
  *
  * The outcome of this analysis influences the call-graph construction as well as other analyses.
  * Please make sure to configure the correct analysis within the configuration file. The relevant
  * configuration key is: "org.opalj.br.analyses.ClosedPackagesKey.packageContext".
  *
  * Sub classes are reflectively instantiated within [[ClosedPackagesKey]] to provide a possibility
  * to configure an analysis-specific understanding of closed packages. Those classes can be configured
  * under the config key: "org.opalj.br.analyses.ClosedPackagesKey.{ClosedPackagesAnalysis}"
  *
  * @note The concept of open and closed packages - and the reason it matters - is discussed in
  *       "Call Graph Construction for Java Libraries"
