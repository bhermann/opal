/**
 * A very basic analysis which identifies those classes that can never be instantiated (e.g.,
 * `java.lang.Math`) by user code.
 *
 * A class is not instantiable if it only defines private constructors and these constructors
 * are not called by any static method and the class is also not Serializable. However,
 * if the static initializer creates an instance of the respective class then it is possible that
 * this a class is rated as not client instantiable though it is possible that an instance
 * exists and may even be used.
 *
 *
 * @note This analysis does not consider protected and/or package visible constructors as
 *      it assumes that classes may be added to the respective package later on (open-packages
 *      assumption.)
 *
 * @note If this class is queried (after performing the analysis) about a class that
 *      was not analyzed, the result will be that the class is considered to be
 *      instantiable.
 *
 * This information is relevant in various contexts, e.g., to determine a
 * precise call graph. For example, instance methods of those objects that cannot be
 * created are always dead. However, this analysis only provides the information whether the
 * class is instantiable by client code!
 *
 * ==Usage==
 * Use the [[InstantiableClassesKey]] to query a project about the instantiable classes.
 * {{{
 * val instantiableClasses = project.get(InstantiableClassesKey)
 * }}}
 *
 * @note The analysis does not take reflective instantiations into account!
 *
 * @note A more precise analysis is available that uses the fixpoint computations framework.
