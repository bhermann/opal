/**
 * Enables the management of the progress of a long running computation.
 * Typically a long running progress such as an analysis is expected to report
 * progress every 250 to 2000 milliseconds. It should .- however -- check every ~100
 * milliseconds the interrupted status to enable a timely termination.
 *
 * This trait defines a call-back interface that is implemented by some class that
 * runs an analysis and which passes an instance of it to some analysis to report
 * progress.
 *
 * @note Implementations of this class must be thread safe if the analysis is multi-
 *      threaded.
 * @note Implementations must handle the case where a step that was started later
 *      finishes earlier than a previous step. In other words, even if the last step
 *      has ended, that does not mean that the analysis as a whole has already finished.
 *      Instead an implementation has to track how many steps have ended to determine
 *      when the whole analysis has ended.

     * An analysis is allowed to just report `End` events. However, if it
     * reports start events it must also report `End` events and it must use
     * the same id to do so. This enables the correlation of the events. The analysis
     * must never report more than one `Start`/`End` event per step id.
     *
     * If the analysis is interrupted it may either signal (as the very last event)
     * a `Killed` event or an `End` event if the analysis completed normally.
     *
     * @param step The step/id of the event. The first event reported by the analysis
     *      has to use the number "1". The step id of the `Killed` event is "-1".
     * @param message An optional message. Typically used in combination with `Start`
     *      events.
