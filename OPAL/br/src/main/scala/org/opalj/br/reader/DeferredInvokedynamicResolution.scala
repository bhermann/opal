     *
     * Deferred resolution is necessary since the [[BootstrapMethodTable]] – which
     * is an attribute of the class file – is loaded after the methods.
     *
     * @note	This method is called (back) after the class file was completely loaded.
     * 			Registration as a callback method happens whenever an `invokedynamic`
     * 			instruction is found in a method's byte code.
     *
     * ==Overriding this Method==
     * To perform additional analyses on `invokedynamic` instructions, e.g. to
     * fully resolve the call target, a subclass may override this method to do so.
     * When you override this method, you should call this method
     * (`super.deferredResolveInvokedynamicInstruction`) to ensure that the default resolution
     * is carried out.
     *
     * @param 	classFile The [[ClassFile]] with which the deferred action was registered.
     * @param 	cp The class file's [[Constant_Pool]].
     * @param 	invokeDynamicInfo The [[INVOKEDYNAMIC]] instruction's constant pool entry.
     * @param 	instructions This method's array of [[instructions.Instruction]]s.
     * 			(The array returned by the [[#Instructions]] method.)
     * @param 	pc The program counter of the `invokedynamic` instruction.
