/**
 * Describes the behavior of the program w.r.t. mutating the fields of a class.
 *
 * A field is considered as ''effectively'' final if the field is:
 *  - actually final or
 *  - if the private field is only set by a constructor or a private helper method that is only
 *    called by a constructor.
 *  - if the field is set at most once to a value that is not the default value (`0`, `0l`, `0f`,
 *    `0d`, `null`) (lazy initialization) and the value is NOT depending on mutable information
 *    (in particular method parameters).
