/**
 * Basic representation of a (calculated) call graph.
 *
 * ==Terminology==
 * A method that calls another method is referred to as the `caller`. The method
 * that is called is called the `callee`. Hence, a caller calls a callee.
 *
 * ==Thread Safety==
 * The call graph is effectively immutable and can be accessed by multiple
 * threads concurrently.
 * Calls will never block.
 *
 * ==Call Graph Construction==
 * The call graph is constructed by the [[CallGraphFactory]].
 *
 * @param calledByMap The map of all methods that are called by at least one method.
 *      I.e., the value is never the empty map.
 * @param callsMap The map of all methods that call at least one method.
 *      I.e., the value is never an empty map.
