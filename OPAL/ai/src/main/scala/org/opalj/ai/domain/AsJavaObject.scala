/**
 * Mixed in by domain's that support the conversation of a `DomainValue` into
 * a respective Java object. This Java object can then be used to perform method
 * invocations.
 *
 * ==Limitation==
 * Using `AsJavaObject` will only work reasonably iff the respective class
 * is either in the classpath of the JVM or a class loader (initialized with the
 * project's classpath) is used.
 * The latter, however, does not work for classes on the bootclasspath (e.g.,
 * `java.lang.String`). In that case it is necessary to check that the code of the
 * analyzed application is compatible with the one on the class path.
 * '''To avoid accidental
 * imprecision in the analysis you should use this features only for stable classes
 * belonging to the core JDK (`java.lang...`.)'''
