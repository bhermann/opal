/**
 * Records the program counters of all instructions that lead to a (ab)normal
 * return from the method. I.e., every instruction that may throw an exception or
 * causes a normal return from method may be recorded. Examples of instructions
 * that may be recorded: `(X)return`, `throw`, `invoke(XXX)`, `get|put(static|field)`,
 * `checkcast`, `(a)new(array)`,... . Instructions such as `swap` or `dup(XXX)`, however,
 * never directly lead to a method return (they will never result in an exception)
 * and will not be recorded.
 *
 * If you are interested in recording the values use: [[RecordReturnedValues]],
 * [[RecordThrownExceptions]].
 *
 * ==Usage==
 * This domain can be stacked on top of other traits that handle
 * return instructions and abrupt method executions.
