/**
 * The ''key'' object to get a call graph that was calculated using the VTA algorithm.
 *
 * You can assume that – in general – the call graph calculated using the VTA algorithm
 * is more precise than the call graph calculated using the CHA algorithm. Depending
 * on the project, the performance may be better, equal or worse.
 *
 * @example
 *      To get the call graph object use the `Project`'s `get` method and pass in
 *      `this` object.
