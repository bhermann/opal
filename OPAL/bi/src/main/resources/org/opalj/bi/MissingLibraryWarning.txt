AN ANALYSIS RELIED ON TYPE/METHOD/FIELD INFORMATION WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE. That is, if this
message is shown the project is not only incomplete, some analysis also had to make an assumption
about a type/the relation between types, a field or a method which is not available.
This generally results in unsound, imprecise and less comprehensible results and often in a hardly
predictable way.
For example, if the type hierarchy is incomplete, the identification of the "correct" exception
handler may abort if the type hierarchy relation between a thrown and a caught exception is
unknown; speculatively evaluating exception handlers could result in fatally failing analyses,
because a compile-time impossible path is taken.
Another example is that type hierarchy related computations - such as determining the common
supertype of multiple types - may end up in unexpected (intersection) types.
However, to facilitate general usage of OPAL, all analyses can generally be expected to handle
incomplete projects.
To get reliable, precise and sound results consider loading all libraries using (at least) a
library class file reader.
