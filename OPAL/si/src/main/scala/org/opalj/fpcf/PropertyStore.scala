/**
 * A property store manages the execution of computations of properties related to specific
 * entities (e.g., methods, fields and classes of a program). These computations may require and
 * provide information about other entities of the store and the property store implements the logic
 * to handle the dependencies between the entities. Furthermore, the property store may parallelize
 * the computation of the properties as far as possible without requiring users to take care of it;
 * users are also generally not required to think about the concurrency when implementing an
 * analysis.
 *
 * ==Usage==
 * The correct strategy, when using the PropertyStore, is to always continue computing the property
 * of an entity and to collect the dependencies on those elements that are (still) relevant.
 * I.e., if some information is not or just not completely available, the analysis should
 * still continue using the provided information and (internally) records the dependency.
 * Later on, when the analysis has computed its result, it reports the same and informs the
 * framework about its dependencies.
 *
 * ===Core Requirements on Property Computation Functions===
 *  - (At Most One Lazy Function per Property Kind) A specific kind of property is (in each
 *    phase) always computed by only one registered `PropertyComputation` function.
 *    No other analysis is (conceptually) allowed to derive a value for an E/PK pairing
 *    for which a lazy function is registered.
 *  - (Thread-Safe PropertyComputation functions) If a single instance of a property computation
 *    function (which is the standard case) is scheduled for computing the properties of multiple
 *    entities, that function has to be thread safe. I.e., the function may
 *    be executed concurrently for different entities.
 *  - (Non-Overlapping Results) [[PropertyComputation]] functions that are invoked on different
 *    entities have to compute result sets that are disjoint.
 *    For example, an analysis that performs a computation on class files and
 *    that derives properties of a specific kind related to a class file's methods must ensure
 *    that the same analysis running concurrently on two different class files do not derive
 *    information about the same method.
 *  - (Monoton) If a `PropertyComputation` function calculates (refines) a (new) property for
 *    a specific element then the result must be equal or more specific.
 *
 * ===Closed-strongly Connected Component Dependencies===
 * In general, it may happen that some analyses cannot make any progress, because
 * they are mutually dependent. In this case the computation of a property `p` of an entity `e1`
 * depends on the property `p'` of an entity `e2` that requires the property `p` of the entity `e1`.
 * In this case a registered strategy is used to resolve the cyclic dependency. If no strategy is
 * available all current values will be committed, if no "current" value is available the fallback
 * value will be committed.
 *
 * ==Thread Safety==
 * A PropertyStore is thread-safe.
 *
 * ==Common Abbreviations==
 * - e =         Entity
 * - p =         Property
 * - ps =        Properties (the properties of an entity - one per kind)
 * - pk =        Property Key
 * - pc =        Property Computation
 * - lpc =       Lazy Property Computation
 * - c =         Continuation (The part of the analysis that factors in all properties of dependees)
 * - EPK =       Entity and a PropertyKey
 * - EP =        Entity and an associated Property
 * - EOptionP =  Entity and either a PropertyKey or (if available) a Property
