/**
 * A log context associates log messages with a specific context and logger.
 * Using a log context facilitates the suppression of recurring message in a specific context
 * and also makes it possible to direct messages to different targets.
 * Before using a `LogContext` it has to be registered with the [[OPALLogger$]].
 *
 * OPAL uses two primary log contexts:
 *
 *  1. The [[GlobalLogContext$]] which should be used for general
 *      log messages related to OPAL, such as the number of threads used for
 *      computations.
 *
 *  1. The log context associated with [[org.opalj.br.analyses.Project]]s to log
 *      project related information (e.g., such as project related results or
 *      configuration issues.)
 *
 * @note The registration of the `LogContext` with the `OPALLogger` does not prevent
 *      the garbage collection of the `LogContext` unless a logged message explicitly
 *      references its log context. This is – however – discouraged! If no message
 *      explicitly reference the log context it is then possible to unregister the log
 *      context in the `finalize` method that references the context.
