/**
 * Identifies a collection as being (guaranteed) complete or as being potentially incomplete.
 *
 * This class is typically used by analyses that derive some results and which are also able to
 * do so in case of incomplete information. But in the latter case the analysis may not be able
 * to determine whether the derived information is complete or not. For example, imagine you
 * are analyzing some library (but not the JDK). In this case the class hierarchy will be incomplete
 * and every analysis using it may compute incomplete information.
