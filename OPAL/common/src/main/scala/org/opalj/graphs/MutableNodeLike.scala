/**
 * Represents a mutable node of a directed graph.
 * This class serves as a base implementation of the [[MutableNode]] trait.
 *
 * ==Thread Safety==
 * This class is thread-safe. It is possible to add multiple child nodes concurrently.
 *
 * @see    The demo project for example usages.
 *
 * @tparam I The type of the object that is associated with this node/the type of
 *         the object for which this node object is created.
 * @param  theIdentifier The underlying object. '''For all nodes of a graph the hashCode method
 *         has to return a unique id unless the nodeId method is overridden.'''
 *         '''The underlying object must correctly implement the equals/hashCode contract.
 *         I.e., the `hashCode` of two object instances that are added to the same graph is
 *         different whenever `equals` is `false`'''.
 * @param  identifierToString A function that converts "an" identifier to a string. By
 *         default the given object's `toString` method is called. It is possible
 *         that a graph has two nodes with the same textual representation representation
 *         but a different identity.
