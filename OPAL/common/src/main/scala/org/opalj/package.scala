/**
 * OPAL is a Scala-based framework for the static analysis, manipulation and creation of
 * Java bytecode. OPAL is designed with performance, scalability and adaptability in mind.
 *
 * Its main components are:
 *  - a library (`Common`) which provides generally useful data-structures and algorithms
 *    for static analyses.
 *  - a framework for parsing Java bytecode (`Bytecode Infrastructure`) that can be used to
 *    create arbitrary representations.
 *  - a library to create a one-to-one in-memory representation of Java bytecode
 *    (`Bytecode Disassembler`).
 *  - a library to create a representation of Java bytecode that facilitates writing
 *    simple static analyses (`Bytecode Representation` - [[org.opalj.br]]).
 *  - a scalable, easily customizable framework for the abstract interpretation of
 *    Java bytecode (`Abstract Interpretation Framework` - [[org.opalj.ai]]).
 *  - a library to extract dependencies between code elements and to facilitate checking
 *    architecture definitions.
 *  - a library for the lightweight manipulation and creation of Java bytecode.
 *
 * ==General Design Decisions==
 *
 * ===Thread Safety===
 * Unless explicitly noted, '''OPAL is thread safe'''. I.e., the classes defined by
 * OPAL can be considered to be thread safe unless otherwise stated.
 * (For example, it is possible to read and process class files concurrently without
 * explicit synchronization on the client side.)
 *
 * ===No `null` Values===
 * Unless explicitly noted, '''OPAL does not `null` values'''
 * I.e., fields that are accessible will never contain `null` values and methods will
 * never return `null`.  '''If a method accepts `null` as a value for a parameter or
 * returns a `null` value it is always explicitly documented.'''
 * In general, the behavior of methods that are passed `null` values is undefined unless
 * explicitly documented.
 *
 * ===No Typecasts for Collections===
 * For efficiency reasons, OPAL sometimes uses mutable data-structures internally.
 * After construction time, these data-structures are generally represented using
 * their generic interfaces (e.g., `scala.collection.{Set,Map}`). However, a downcast
 * (e.g., to add/remove elements) is always forbidden as it would effectively prevent
 * thread-safety. Furthermore, the concrete data-structure is always
 * considered an implementation detail and may change at any time.
 *
 * ===Assertions===
 * OPAL makes heavy use of Scala's '''Assertion Facility''' to facilitate writing correct
 * code. Hence, for production builds (after thorough testing(!)) it is
 * highly recommend to build OPAL again using `-Xdisable-assertions`.
