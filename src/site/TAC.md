# 3-Address Code / Quadruples Code / Static Single Assigment Form

OPAL provides an easy mechanism to transform bytecode into a 3-address code which is also sometimes called "Quadruples Code". The representation provided by OPAL is always in SSA form and is created after performing a low-level, highly configurable data-flow analysis. In all cases the 3-address code (in the following called **TAC**) immediately provides complete def-use information and the control-flow graph is also reified.

## Exploring the 3-Address representation

A very simple way to explore the TAC generated by OPAL is to use the TAC tool which is part of the *Abstract Interpretation Framework*. To use it start the sbt console, change to the Abstract Interpretation framework and specify the method for which you want to have the TAC.
 
    current_folder$ sbt shell
    > project AbstracInterpretationFramework
    >  run <source jar; e.g., ../bi/target/scala-2.11/resource_managed/test/ai.jar> <name of the class; e.g., ai.domain.DeadVariables> <name of the mehtod; e.g., initialValueIsAlwaysDead>
    
If the method is found, you will get the control-flow graph, the TAC created using a naive approach (which you are NOT expected to use and which we will not further discuss) and the TAC generated using a very lightweight intra-procedural abstract interpretation/advanced data-flow analysis.
