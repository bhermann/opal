# 3-Address Code / Quadruples Code / Static Single Assigment Form

OPAL provides an easy mechanism to transform Java bytecode into a 3-address code which is also sometimes called "Quadruples Code". The standard representation provided by OPAL is always in SSA form and is created after performing a low-level, highly configurable data-flow analysis; based on the configured low-level analysis, the amount of additional information about the program's values may differ greatly. In the simplest case, only basic type information is provided. In more advanced cases, constant computations are perfomed, constants are propagated, must-alias information is provided, dead paths due to progamming errors are automatically pruned, and so on. In all cases the 3-address code (in the following called **TAC**) immediately provides complete def-use information and the control-flow graph is also reified.

## Exploring the 3-Address representation

A very simple way to explore the TAC generated by OPAL is to use the TAC tool which is part of the *Abstract Interpretation Framework*. To use it, start the sbt console, change to the *Abstract Interpretation Framework* and specify the method for which you want to have the TAC.
 
    current_folder$ sbt shell
    > project AbstracInterpretationFramework
    >  run <source jar; e.g., ../bi/target/scala-2.11/resource_managed/test/ai.jar> <name of the class; e.g., ai.domain.DeadVariables> <name of the mehtod; e.g., initialValueIsAlwaysDead>
    
If the method is found, you will get the control-flow graph and the TAC generated using a lightweight abstract interpretation/advanced data-flow analysis. (Additionally, you can get the TAC created using a naive approach - which you are NOT expected to use and which is not discussed.) 


## Examples

To better understand the TAC provided by OPAL, we will discuss some examples. You can run the examples on your own using the discussed steps.
