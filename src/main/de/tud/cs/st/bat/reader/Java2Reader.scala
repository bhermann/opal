/**
 * <p>
 * Framework to align all readers to one specific representations per class file entity. E.g. 
 * all readers use the same type for Constant_Pool_Entry, Attribute, etc.. However, this class
 * does not prescribe the concrete representation e.g. of a field or method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We do want to have a concrete framework for reading class files that can be tailored
 * w.r.t. the OO representation that is generated while parsing the class files. <br />
 * 
 * To enable this flexibility the class (traits) to read in various parts of a Java class file call 
 * factory methods to create objects that 
 * represents each "significant (read: all entitities described in the JVM Spec.)" class file entry.
 * Since each reader of a class file entity should be independently reusable, abstract types and factory methods are used to 
 * specify dependencies of a reader on entities read by other readers; readers do not have direct
 * dependencies on other readers or the created classes.
 * However, some readers do make some (minimal) assumptions about the constant pool and, hence, 
 * specify this dependency by refering to an interface that represents the constant_pool and 
 * which declares the required method.
 * </p>
