/**
 * Represents the immutable results of a query.

 * @param  id A very short identifier of this feature. E.g., `Java8ClassFile` or

 *         special characters.
 * @param  count How often the feature was found in a project.
 * @param  extensions (Some of) The places where the feature was found. This information is
 *         primarily useful when navigating the project and is optional.
 *         I.e., `extensions.size` can be  smaller than `count`. The maximum number
 *         of stored locations is set using the global setting: "org.opalj.hermes.maxLocations"
