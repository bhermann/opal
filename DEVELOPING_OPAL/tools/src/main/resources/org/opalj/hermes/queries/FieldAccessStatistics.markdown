# Field Access Statistics

Reports information about the usage of fields in the project, which do not define compile-time constants.  *Primitive constants – e.g., `public final static double pi = 3.1d` – and string constants are typically inlined by compilers and it is therefore "normal" that these fields have no (more) use.*


Reflective accesses are not considered.
