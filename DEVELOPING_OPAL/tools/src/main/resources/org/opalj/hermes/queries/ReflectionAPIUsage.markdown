## Reflection features from Java 6 and earlier

The following features are targeted by the analysis:

- Usage of `Class.forName`
- (reflective) creation of new Instances
- (reflective) field write
- (reflective) field read
- setting the accessibility of `Field`, `Method`, `Constructor`or other `AccessibleObject` objects in general
- (reflective) method invocations

## Reflection features from Java 7 and later
